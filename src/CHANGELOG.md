# CHANGELOG

1. **Snow Golems** can now be interacted with set items.
   - Interacting with **_any color_** of Carpets will add a scarf of that color.
   - Interacting with **_Carrots, Beetroots, Potatoes, or Wheat_** will add noses or hair made of that material.
     - This can only be done if they do not have a Pumpkin head.
   - Interacting with **_Carved Pumpkins_** will add back their Pumpkin head.
   - Items can be sheared off of Snow Golems, and will prioritize head items over scarves.
2. **Snowballs** now have sounds when they hit things.
