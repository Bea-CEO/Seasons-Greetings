# CHANGELOG

1. **Snow Golems** can now be interacted with set items.
   - Interacting with **_any color_** of Carpets will add a scarf of that color.
   - Interacting with **_Carrots, Beetroots, Potatoes, or Wheat_** will add noses or hair made of that material.
     - This can only be done if they do not have a Pumpkin head.
   - Interacting with **_Carved Pumpkins_** will add back their Pumpkin head.
   - Items can be sheared off of Snow Golems, and will prioritize head items over scarves.


2. **Snowballs** now have sounds when they hit things.
    - They also have a 20% chance to place Snow Layers on the ground when they hit a block.

### 3. Cauldrons
- Powder Snow Cauldrons can now be right-clicked with any item other than a Bucket to empty them layer by layer and collect Snowballs.
- Water Cauldrons above heat sources can have Chocolate thrown into them to become a Hot Cocoa Cauldron.
  - Right-clicking on Hot Cocoa Cauldrons with Bottles will give up to 3 Hot Cocoa Bottles, which can be drank to give the player the "Cozy" effect, temporarily making them immune to Freezing.
